Project Description:

I built a one player hangman game where the player needs to guess the randomly selected Grateful Dead song one letter at a time. Each time the player is wrong another body part of Jerry Garcia is added to the noose. If the player guesses the name of the song before all of the body parts are added then Jerry Garcia is saved and plays to the dancing bears on the screen. 

1. Wireframe pictures are within the Wireframe card on Trello in the "Done" card.

3. I used jQuery for most of my logic code which I linked in my HTML file. When I had questions I referenced stackoverflow generally. I got my pictures from here:

5. In version two I would like to have the random song play in background while the user is guessing. I would like to add animations on button clicks and letter reveals. I also would want to have a scoreboard keeping track of high scores. Version 3 would post a video of a live performance of the song guessed when the player won.
